CHICKEN benchmarks

The benchmark programs have been taken from CHICKEN version 4.2.0.  A
simpler runner (run.scm) has been implemented.

  $ ./run.scm -h
  Usage: run.scm [ config file ]

The configuration file (optional) is a scheme file which can set the
following parameters:

* repetitions: number of times each benchmark program is executed
    (default = 3)

* installation-prefix: the CHICKEN installation prefix (default = #f,
    use CHICKEN tools from $PATH)

* csc-options: options to be passed to csc

* log-file: a sexpr-formatted log file where results are written
    (default = benchmark.log)

* debug?: shows the executed shell commands

If the configuration file is not provided, run.scm will pick the
CHICKEN tools from $PATH.


Configuration file example:

  $ cat 4.7.0.conf
  (installation-prefix "/usr/local/chicken-4.7.0")
  (csc-options "-O3")
